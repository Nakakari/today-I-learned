# Q1. 
    - Explain what it means by:
        - loosely typed dynamic language
        - JavaScript Type Casting
        - ==, ===
## A1
    Loosely typed dynamic language:

    ```kotlin
       A Loosely typed programming language is defined as a language where defining a variable's data type is not requiredd.
    ```
    JavaScript Type Casting:

    ```kotlin
    Type casting means conversion of one data type to another explicitly. In JavaScript some of the most common methods to convert a datatype to either string using String(), to boolean using Boolean(), or to number using Number().
    ```
    ==, ===

    ```kotlin
    - Double equals used as Type converting the conversion.
    - Triple equals used as Strict conversion without performing any conversion in operands.
    ```
# Q2

        - What is the **problem** of a loosely typed dynamic language, and what are the ways to **supplement** it?
