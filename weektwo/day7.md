- Know more about immutable in react.
    An immutable variable can never be changed. To update its value, you create a new variable.

    The same applies to objects and arrays.

    Instead of changing an array, to add a new item you create a new array by concatenating the old array, plus the new item.
    An object is never updated, but copied before changing it.
