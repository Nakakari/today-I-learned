## What I've learn?
<aside>
ğŸ”‘ What is the main difference betweenÂ `useCallback` andÂ `useMemo`? And when to useÂ `useCallback` of React Hooks?

</aside>

`useMemo(() => (bar) => foo + bar, [foo]);`

Equivalent code with useCallback:

`useCallback((bar) => foo + bar, [foo]);`

Use callback isÂ **just a shorthand** variation ofÂ `useMemo`Â to use with functions. 

Here is why it exists: When you useÂ `useMemo`, the value usually changes when one of its dependencies changes. For example:

`const fullName = useMemo(() => firstName + lastName, [firstName, lastName]);`

Here, whenÂ `firstName`orÂ `lastName`change, we don't need to have a completely different function with a different body, but we do need to have a new instance of the same function so that it has up to date values in closure (dependencies). So React team just added it for convenience as it is a common use case, and theÂ `() => () =>`syntax is somewhat ugly.
